# ARTSS

## Installation

To set up the ARTSS system, follow these steps:

1. **Assemble the hardware**: Connect the Arduino board, ultrasonic sensor, metal detector, servo motors, and reed switch according to the wiring diagram provided in the ARTSS Handbook.

2. **Check wire conditions**: Use a multimeter to ensure all wires are in good condition and can transmit electricity properly, as outlined in the handbook.

3. **Load the Arduino sketch**: Connect your computer to the Arduino board using the appropriate cable, open the Arduino IDE, and upload the provided `.ino` file to the board.

4. **Test individual components**: Follow the testing procedures in the ARTSS Handbook to verify the functionality of each component, including the ultrasonic sensor, metal detector, servo motors, and reed switch.

5. **Finalize assembly**: Secure all components in their designated positions as per the design specifications, ensuring that all moving parts are free of obstructions and the system is stable.

## Usage

Once the ARTSS system is installed, initiate the sorting process with the following steps:

1. **Power up the system**: Ensure that the Arduino board and all connected components are powered.

2. **Start the sorting program**: The main program, 'Finalize presentation 3.0', will manage the sorting process. Monitor the serial output for status updates and any error messages.

3. **Insert waste items**: Add waste items into the system. The ARTSS will sort plastic bottles, aluminum cans, and tin cans into their corresponding recycling bins.

4. **Maintenance checks**: Regularly perform maintenance checks as detailed in the handbook to ensure the system continues to function optimally.

## Features

ARTSS boasts several innovative features:

- **Non-recyclable Trash Sorting**: Smaller non-recyclable items are sorted out due to their size.
- **Metal Separation**: Differentiates between aluminum and tin cans using electromagnetic properties.
- **Plastic Identification**: Sorts plastic materials using an electric insulation characteristic.
- **Adaptable Sorting**: Any unsorted objects are defaulted to aluminum can sorting.

## Design

The ARTSS system utilizes a combination of rotating and non-rotating parts to sort recyclables:

- **Metal Detector**: Identifies and separates metals from non-metals.
- **Main Wheel**: Equipped with magnets to separate tin (ferrous) from aluminum (non-ferrous).
- **Servo Motors**: Control the movement of the main wheel and the trapdoor for accurate sorting.
- **Reed Switch**: Ensures precise positioning of the main wheel for the sorting process.

## Troubleshooting

Refer to the ARTSS Handbook for detailed troubleshooting steps for each component. Common issues and their solutions include:

- **Wiring Issues**: If the system is not functioning correctly, check all connections and replace any faulty wires.
- **Sensor Problems**: Use the Arduino IDE to upload test sketches and verify the functionality of the ultrasonic sensor and metal detector.
- **Servo Motor Malfunctions**: If a servo motor is not moving, check the wiring and replace the motor if necessary.
